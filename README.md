# Issue Tracker

Issue Tracker is a web application created as a pet project by a frontend developer to practice and gain experience in building websites using Next.js 13.

## Key Technologies I Have Used

- Typescript
- Next.js 13
- Next Auth
- Radix
- Axios
- React-hook-form
- And more...

## How to Get Started?

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. In the project folder, rename **.env.example** to **.env** (no period after).
3. Set **all** the environment variables according to the instructions I've included in the file. If you don't set them properly, the application is not going to work.
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
5. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to generate your database tables.
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the web server.
